# pasword-generator

This is a program that uses JavaScript to generate a password based on the user's choice of included character types (lopwercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters).

To use this, open it in a browser, or use my deployed link (https://sam-st.github.io/pasword-generator/). Once you reach the site click "generate password" and go through the prompts to choose what character you want included.
If you select no characters you will get a message saying that no password is possible to create, if you enter a number outside of the given parameters, or not a number at all, you will get the same message.
Once you go through all the prompts the generated random password will appear in the text box.

A screenshot of a little later on where I realized I could add all the characters to an array and make a string out of that array to add or leave out certain characters
